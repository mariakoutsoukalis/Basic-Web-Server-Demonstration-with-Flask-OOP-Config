# Flask Application Wrapper

This project consists of a Python script that demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to create a Flask application. The application is wrapped in a custom class, `FlaskWrapper`

## Features

- Object-oriented approach to Flask app configuration.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python and Flask installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the source code.
3. Navigate to the application directory.

## Usage

To run the application:

1. Start the Flask server by executing the app script:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

2. Access the application in a web browser at `http://localhost:1234`.

## FlaskWrapper Class

- The `FlaskWrapper` class encapsulates the Flask app instance and its configurations.

## Routes and Endpoints

- The application includes a basic route (`/`) which returns "Hello, World!".
- Additional routes and view functions can be added within the `FlaskWrapper` class.

## Customization

You can customize the Flask application by editing the `FlaskWrapper` class. Add new routes, view functions, and other configurations as needed.
